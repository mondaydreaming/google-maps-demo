# Google Maps Class Demo

This is a basic demo of using the Google Maps JavaScript v3 API.

I have constructed a few simple examples to show how to get the API up and running.

## Getting Started

Before you begin you must obtain an API key from the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). You can make 25,000 requests per day **fo' free**.
